Frontend uses React.js, backend uses Django


NOTE:

Frontend folder lacks "node_modules" as it is too big to add to github repo (can be added by running npm install in the frontend folder)

Backend folder lacks "env" since it is also too big (can be added by creating your own virtual env in the backend folder)
